# hospital-management

A simple command‑line Hospital Management System (HMS) in Java for managing patients, doctors, and scheduling appointments.

##  Overview

This lightweight HMS allows you to:
- Add and view patients (auto-generated IDs)
- Add and view doctors with specialties
- Schedule appointments by selecting patient and doctor IDs
- View all scheduled appointments in one overview

Built using core Java concepts and standard I/O, the program demonstrates basic OOP design and console-based CRUD operations.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer
- A terminal or command‑line interface to compile and run Java code

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or download the project  
Ensure all `.java` files (`Patient.java`, `Doctor.java`, `Appointment.java`, `HospitalManagementSystem.java`) are in one folder.

### 2. Compile the code  
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:  
```bash
javac *.java
